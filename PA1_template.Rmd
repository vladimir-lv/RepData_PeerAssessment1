## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
df_act<-read.csv("activity.csv",sep=',',header=TRUE)
df_act$date<-as.Date(df_act$date)
summary(df_act)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
df_act_sum<-aggregate(steps ~ date,data=df_act,sum)
df_act_sum
mean(df_act_sum$steps)
median(df_act_sum$steps)
df_hist<-hist(df_act_sum$steps, breaks = 10,main = "Total number of steps taken each day",xlab = "Number of steps")
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}

df_day_pattern<-aggregate(steps ~ interval,data=df_act,mean)

plot(steps ~ interval,data=df_day_pattern,type="l")
```


## Imputing missing values
```{r}
sum(is.na(df_act))

df_empty<-df_act[is.na((df_act$steps)),]

```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
